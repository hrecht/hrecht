Hello — I’m a data reporter who investigates how the decisions made by people in power affect our lives using statistical analysis, graphics, and traditional reporting techniques.

I built and maintain [censusapi](https://github.com/hrecht/censusapi), an R package that makes it easy to grab U.S. Census Bureau data programmatically.
