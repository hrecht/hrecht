Hello — I’m a data reporter who investigates how the decisions made by people in power affect our lives using statistical analysis, graphics, and traditional reporting techniques.

I built and maintain [censusapi](https://github.com/hrecht/censusapi), an R package that makes it easy to grab U.S. Census Bureau data programmatically.

I’m available for full-time or contract data journalism, programming, and analysis jobs. See more and reach out on [my website](https://www.hrecht.com/).
